# Window views dataset



## Introduction

Window Views is an open, manually annotated dataset of window views in a high density city (Wuhan). The original data was taken from the balcony window views of 300 apartments listed for sale in August 2022 on the Chinese real estate online marketplaces [lianjia](https://wh.lianjia.com/) in August 2022. The pictures names start with a 12-digit number and can be accessed via [https://wh.lianjia.com/ershoufang/[12-digit-number].html] for the website to which the apartments belong, but as apartments are sold and taken off the market, the link available becomes smaller.

We performed a series of processes on the raw data and manually annotated it into 11 categories:

1. Sky
2. High-rise buildings
3. Low-rise buildings
4. Grasses
5. Hard ground
6. Trees
7. Water
8. Railings
9. Roads
10. Barren land
11. Building interior
