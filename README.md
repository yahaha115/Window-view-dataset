# Window views dataset



## Introduction

Window Views is an open, manually annotated dataset of window views in a high density city (Wuhan). The original data was taken from the balcony window views of 300 apartments listed for sale in August 2022 on the Chinese real estate online marketplaces [lianjia](https://wh.lianjia.com/) in August 2022. The picture names start with a 12-digit number and can be accessed via [https://wh.lianjia.com/ershoufang/[12-digit number].html]for the website to which the picture belong, but as apartments are sold and taken off the market, the link available becomes smaller.

We performed a series of processes on the raw data and manually annotated it into 11 categories:
Sky
High-rise buildings
Low-rise buildings
Grasses
Hard ground
Trees
Water
Railings
Roads
Barren land
Building interior
