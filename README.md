# Window views dataset

##

## Introduction

Window Views is an open, manually annotated dataset of window views in a high density city. The original data was taken from the balcony window views of 300 Wuhan apartments listed for sale in August 2022 on the Chinese real estate trading platform [lianjia](https://wh.lianjia.com/) in August 2022. The image names start with a 12-digit number and can be accessed via https://wh.lianjia.com/ershoufang/[12-digit number].html for the website to which the images belong, but as homes are sold and taken off the market, the number available becomes smaller.

We performed a series of processes on the raw data and manually annotated it into 11 categories:SkyHigh-rise buildingsLow-rise buildingsGrassesHard groundTreesWaterRailingsRoadsBarren landBuilding interior
